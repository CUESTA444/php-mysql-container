This **PHP MySQL Containers for ICI IT Students** is a running container with a well-defined tool/runtime stack and its prerequisites, especially PHP and MySQL. PHP library is installed with the latest version while MySQL is currently on testing.

> **Note:** If you already have a Codespace created already, you can jump to the [Things to try](#things-to-try) section.

## Setting up the development container for your project
### GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Student Developer Pack
1. To use GitHUB Codespaces, make sure you already registered your ICI-email address to GitHub.
2. Visit https://education.github.com/pack to activate, follow the instructions from GitHub. 
3. Verification process is automatic but GitHub Education team needs evidence that you are an officially enrolled student of Iligan Computer Institute.
4. (optional) To send your Student ID as part of the verification, follow this instructions, take pictures on both front and back then edit them to be as one picture and attach it to the submission form.
5. (optional) To send your COR / Certificate of Registration as evidence for verification, take a photo of your COR then upload it to the submission form.
6. Depends on the selected document for verification, expect an email coming from GitHub Education Team with the message, "Welcome to Github Global Campus", that indicates that your Student Developer Pack has been activated an able to use GitHub Codespaces at no charge.

### GitHub Codespaces
Follow these steps to open this sample in a Codespace:
1. Click **Use this template** drop-down menu.
2. Click on the **Create a repository** tab.
3. The owner profile should be **ici-github** so that I can easily access your repositories.
4. The **repository name** can be any name, just make sure that the name relates to your project or performance task.
5. Input the repository description thats best relate to your project or performance tasks.
6. You can set permissions to your repository, if you want to keep it on your own then select Private.
7. Once you filled in all information required. Click **Create repository from template**
8. Once done, you can proceed opening your repository without affecting the template repository by clicking **Code** then select **Codespaces** and lastly **Create codespace on main** to get started.

## Things to try

Once you have the working codespace, you'll be able to work with it like you would locally.

Some things to try:

1. **DON'TS:**
   - DO NOT DELETE `index.php` file, this will list your files and directories when PHP is started.
   - It is recommended to create Folders based on Performance Task number (G11) and abbreviated system name for Grade 12.
   - DO NOT DELETE OR MODIFYTHE FILES AND FOLDERS THAT ARE BUILT FROM THE TEMPLATE IT WOULD CAUSE A CRASH ON YOUR CONTAINERS.

1. **Running a server:**
   - From the terminal, run `php -S 0.0.0.0:8000`
   - Click "Open in Browser" in the notification that appears to access the web app on this new port.
   
1. For Grade 12 students only:
   - Since most of the Performance Tasks needs a MySQL database connection, you will be accessing them externally.
   - To request a MySQL account, please email jerick.almeda@ici.edu.ph, make sure that you're indicating your block and reason.
   - Instructions will be sent thru your ICI-email address.
